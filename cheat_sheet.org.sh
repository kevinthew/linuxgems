* Command Reference:
** Basics:
*** Getting help:

# View the manual for target command
man [command]

# Get help with a target command (probably the same as above, but not always):
[command] -h

# In case you forget the name of a command, print possible commands relating to [guess]:
apropos [guess]

# View index of help pages:
info

*** Command Line Utilities:
**** Basic File and Directory Operations:
# Print current working directory:
pwd

# Show files in current directory:
ls

# Show maximum information about all files, including hidden:
ls -a

# Recurse into subdirectories and list those as well:
ls -r

# Move/rename a file or directory (be careful that you don't move the source over a destination with the same name):
mv [source] [destination]

# Delete target forever (be very careful), use -r recursive flag for directories:
rm [target]

# Copy file or directory:
cp [source] [destination]

# Mount filesystem:
mount /dev/[device name] /media/[device name]

# Unmount:
umount /media/[device name]

# Forensically clone filesystems and do other low-level operations on files. Very dangerous:
dd

# Work with filesystems and partitions. (Easier, still quite dangerous):
fdisk

**** System Administration:

# Execute command as an administrator (dangerous, but necessary for system administration tasks):
sudo [command]

# Become system administrator:
sudo -s

# Quit system administration:
exit

# Check distro repositories for software updates:
sudo apt-get update

# Download and install updates (update first):
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Search for package in the repositories:
apt-cache search [keyword]

# Get more detail on one specific package:
apt-cache show [package name]

# Download and install a package:
sudo apt-get install [package name]

# View the output of a command in a more convenient format:
[command] | less

**** Working With Files:

# Print a file in terminal:
cat [file]

# Find files matching [filename]:
locate [filename]

# Search through [filename] for matches to [phrase]:
grep [phrase] [filename]

# Search through output of a command for [phrase]:
[command] | grep [phrase]

**** Working With Processes:

# List all running processes:
ps -e

# Standard system monitor showing a more extensive view of all processes and system resources:
top

# Like top, but with a better, cleaner interface:
htop

# Stop a process from using all system resources and lagging computer:
nice [process name]

# Kill misbehaving process (use sparingly, last resort, try 'nice' command first):
pkill [process name]

**** Compression and Encryption:

# Make a simple compressed backup of a file or directory:
tar -cvzf [backup output.tgz] [target file or directory]

# Open a compressed .tgz or .tar.gz file:
tar -xvf [target.tgz]

# Encrypt a file:
gpg -o [outputfilename.gpg] -c [target file]

# Decrypt a file:
gpg -o [outputfilename] -d [target.gpg]

# Zip and encrypt a directory simultaneously:
gpg-zip -o encrypted-filename.tgz.gpg -c -s file-to-be-encrypted

*** The Bash shell:
**** File Name expansions:
# Current user's home directory:
~/

# Current directory:
./

# Parent directory:
../

# Or even (Two parent directories down):
../../

# All files in target directory. (Be very careful.):
/*

**** Output Redirects:

# Redirect output of one command into the input of another with a pipe:
[command 1] | [command 2]

# Or even:

[command 1] | [command 2] | [command 3]

# Redirect output to a file:
[command] > file

# Or:

[file] > [file]

# Or even, to redirect in a different direction:
[file] < [file]

# Append output rather than writing over the target file:

[file/command] >> [file]

# Works like |, but it writes output to both target and terminal:
tee [target]

**** Controlling Execution:
# Wait until [command 1] is finished to execute [command 2]
[command 1] ; [command 2]

# Or even:
[command 1] ; [command 2] ; [command 3]

**** Wildcards:
# Zero or more characters:
*

# Matches "phrase" and any number of trailing characters:
phrase*

# Matches any incidences of "phrase" with any trailing or leading chars:
*phrase*

# Matches any one char:
?

# Matches any of the characters listed inside brackets:
[chars]

# Matches a range of chars between a-z:
[a-z]

** Advanced:
*** Command Line Utilities, Continued:
**** Networking:

# Configure network interfaces:
ifconfig

# Configure wireless network interfaces:
iwconfig

# Connect to a remote server.
ssh [username]@[ipaddress]

# Forward x from target to current machine (Get a remote desktop. Very obscure and very useful):
ssh -x [username]@[ipaddress]

# Copy files over the network from one machine to another:
scp [source filename]:[username]@[ipaddress] [target filename]:[target username]@[target ipaddress]

# Copy only changes between files or directories (super efficient way to sync directories, works either locally or with remote servers using username@ipaddress:optionalport, just like ssh):
rsync [source] [target]

# Check to see if target is online and responding
ping [ip address]

# View network route to target:
traceroute6 [ip address]

# Network Monitor

iptables

# Scan this machine to check for open ports:
nmap 127.0.0.1

***** netcat:

# Listen for input from network on [recieving port], dump it to a file (possibly insecure):
netcat -l [recieving port] > file_copied

# Pipe the output of a command to a target ip and port over the network:
[command] | netcat -w [number of seconds before timeout] [target ip] [target port]

# Use tar to compress and output a file as a stream, pipe it to a target ip and port over the network:
sudo tar -czf - [filename] | netcat -w [number of seconds before timeout] [target ip] [target port]

**** Users and Groups:
# Change owner of a file or directory:
chown

# View the differences between two files:
diff [file 1] [file 2]

# Output the top -n lines of [file]:
head -n [number of lines] [file]

# Like head, but it outputs the last -n lines:
tail

# Checksum a file:
md5sum [file]

# Checksum every file in a directory:
md5deep [directory]

# Checksum a file (safer algorithm with no hash collisions):
sha1sum

# Same operation as md5deep, but using sha1:
sha1deep

# Call [command] every -n seconds, and display output:
watch -n [number of seconds] [command]

# Execute [command], print how long it took:
time [command]

# View files in home from largest to smallest:
du -a ~/ | sort -n -r | less

# remove spaces from filenames in current directory
